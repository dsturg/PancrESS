# Calc ess

```{r}

# You can filter to include only genes at
# some maximum expression level, for example:

myESS <- subset(myESS, Max_expr >= 100)
head(myESS)

# This is an example of using the gini coefficient
# Note this returns a vector
myGini <- calcESS(sce,c("alpha", "beta","acinar","ductal"),"median","gini")

# This is an example of using tau
# This also returns a vector
myTau <- calcESS(sce,c("alpha", "beta","acinar","ductal"),"median","tau")
